# short-from
AI pipeline to create short-form content

key word --> 30 second script --> generate 5 random images based on the word --> create the audio of the script --> create a slide show of the images with the speech playing

I would like to make this more complicated by unfortunately I have an RX580, which doesn't allow for CUDO, so I'm running this off my CPU.
In the future, a video instead of images would be better, but the videos I can create with my hardware are incomprehensible.
